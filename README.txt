1.STARTUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon getting VAMIX, you must run it using the console. Navigate to the directory of the VAMIX using cd [directory] and cd .. to get around. Once in the directory, use the command below to allow running of the .jar file.

>java -jar VAMIX_lhor612_sbut576.jar

Once run, it may take a short time to begin on slower machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Opening files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the VAMIX is running, you can select files from directories on your system utilising the OPEN button, and then navigating through directories using the panel. Once a file is selected, there are 2 options. ACCEPTING or DECLINING:

ACCEPTING:
This is where the file has been accepted, meaning that it is a video (simple only) type file, which is always accepted by VAMIX. This may or may not allow video editing depending on audio channels *(see Editing the audio section for help)*.

DECLINING:
This is where the file is not accepted. A pop-up message will appear to tell you that the file selected is not allowed. Though it may be an video/audio file, the VAMIX setup only allows more simple styles of those types, excluding things such as ".rmvb" files.

Once selection has occured, you can continue with other processes in the VAMIX app. This will also start the playing of the video.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Downloading Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloading of file is done utilising the "wget" command from the LINUX family of commands. Thus, this downloading option will only occur on machines using linux or some other process that allows this command. This command can only be reached by accepting that the downloadable file is one that is OPEN-SOURCE. VAMIX holds no responsibility for copyright infringement due to usage of this to download from non-open-source content hosting websites.

Once the command is begun, you may cancel the operation using the "CANCEL" button. This button will stop the process, but the file up to the point of canceling will still exist on your machine. If you do not want this file anymore, you will need to delete it by navigating to it using your own file browsing software. If you choose to download the same file again with a partial download of the file in your system the download will continue from where it was cancelled.

When the command completes, there are 2 outcomes, SUCCESS or FAILURE:

SUCCESS:
This is where the file has been downloaded. Once this has occured, you need to navigate to the file downloaded using the opening panel *(see above for the open panel information)* to start the file in the VAMIX app. From there, you can continue with whatever operations (VAMIX BASED) you wish.

FAILURE:
If the VAMIX system fails, it will give a general message describing how the download failed. This information can be used to resolve the problem and try the download again.
